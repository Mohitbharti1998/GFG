Given a Binary Tree of size N , You have to count leaves in it. For example, there are two leaves in following tree

        1
     /      \
   10      39
  /
5

 

Example 1:


Input:
Given Tree is 
               4
             /   \
            8     10
           /     /   \
          7     5     1
         /
        3 
Output:
3
Explanation: 
Three leaves are 3 , 5 and 1.




Solution:- 


class Tree
{
    int countLeaves(Node root) 
    {
         // Your code  
        if(root == null)
            return 0;
            
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null)
            return 1;
        else
        {
            int left_count = countLeaves(root.left);
            int right_count = countLeaves(root.right);
            return left_count + right_count;
        }
    }
}
