Given two strings a and b consisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “act” and “tac” are an anagram of each other.

Example 1:

Input:
a = geeksforgeeks, b = forgeeksgeeks
Output: YES
Explanation: Both the string have same
characters with same frequency. So, 
both are anagrams.
Example 2:

Input:
a = allergy, b = allergic
Output: NO
Explanation:Characters in both the strings
are not same, so they are not anagrams.








class Solution{    
    
    public static boolean isAnagram(String a,String b)
    {
        
        // Your code here
        
        int[] aa = new int[26];
        int[] bb = new int[26];
        
        for(int i=0;i<a.length();i++)
        {
            aa[a.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<b.length();i++)
        {
            bb[b.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<26;i++)
        {
            if(aa[i] != bb[i])
                return false;
        }
        
        return true;
        
    }
}
