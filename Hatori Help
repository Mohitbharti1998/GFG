Hatori Help
Amara and Kenichi are playing a card game. In beginning both have N cards, each card has an integer number written on it. Yumeko randomly selects K cards from Amara and Kenichi each and calculates the sum of integer numbers written on the selected K cards. The winner is the one whose sum is greater. If the sums are equal then it is declared as a draw. Kenichi wants to know beforehand if he will win or not, no matter which cards are randomly selected from him and Amara. So he calls Hatori and shows him the N cards he is holding. Also, he asks Hatori to use the ninja technique to know the cards Amara is holding. Given the value of K help Hatori to determine whether Kenichi will win or not.

Input format
The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Description of each test case follows:
The first line contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the card values in the hand of Kenichi.
The third line contains N space-separated integers denoting the card values in the hand of Amara.

Output format
For each test case on a new line print "WIN" (without quotes) if Kenichi will definitely win in any scenario else print "LOSE" (without quotes).

Solution:-

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  //write your code here
  int t;
	cin>>t;
	
	while(t--){
	int n,k ;
	cin>>n>>k;
	int a[n] , b[n];
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
	    cin>>a[i];
	}
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
	    cin>>b[i];
	}
	long long int ans=0;
	sort(a,a+n);
	sort(b,b+n , greater<int>());
	int s1 , s2=0;
	s1=0;
	for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
	    s1+=a[i];
	    s2+=b[i];
	}
	if(s1>s2)cout<<"WIN\n";
	else cout<<"LOSE\n";

	}
	
  
  return 0;
}
